== Setup

First, install the dependencies with npm:

    npm install

Then, you can start the frontend service with:

    clj -M:watch

You find the application at http://localhost:8700. Open re-frame 10x with `Ctrl+h`.

Start the backend API with this alias:

    clj -M:run-server

Find the backend server at: http://localhost:3000/ping

There are some more aliases, which can typically be used at hobby projects.

== Using Calva

When you are using Calva, you can start frontend and backend in one REPL Session by using the jack-in command, then choosing `deps.edn` and `:watch` as the preferred alias.
